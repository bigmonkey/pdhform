<h1>What is a Payday Loan?</h1>
<p>A payday loan is a type of short-term, quick fast loan designed for those with poor or no credit and in need of emergency cash. It is underwritten based on your pay check, whereby a single advance on your paycheck is deposited into your checking account and paid off during your next payday.</p>
<h4>How Does A Payday Loan Work?</h4>
<p>To receive a payday loan, you first apply  and get approved for a loan. Once approved, the lender will direct deposit funds into your checking account by the next business day. On your next payday, the lender automatically withdraws funds from your checking account to repay the loan plus fees.Â For more information, see our detailed article on <a href="http://www.thepaydayhound.com/how-payday-loans-work/" title="How Payday Loans Work" target="_blank">how payday loans work</a>.</p>
<h4>Who Can Receive a Payday Loan?</h4>
<p>Almost anyone who is both employed and has an active checking account  with direct-deposited paychecks can receive a payday loan.</p>
<h4>Is a Payday Loan What I Need?</h4>
<p>Payday loans are designed to meet short-term, emergency cash needs. They are not a good choice for longer term borrowing needs.</p>
<h4>How Much Can I Borrow?</h4>
<p>The amount you can borrow depends on  the payday loan lender. Payday loan providers can lend   as much as  $1,000. </p>
