<h1>How This Works</h1>
<p>We  connect you to a network of over 150 payday loan lenders, including offline payday loan lenders.  It is convenient and easy, as you only have to fill out one application and do not  have to apply for multiple payday direct lenders until you are approved for one. Once you fill out an application, we will  send your application to lenders on our list.</p>
<p>Should multiple lenders be willing to grant you a payday loan or a cash advance, we will automatically choose a lender that best meets your needs. For example, if you want to borrow $500  and there are three lenders willing to loan you money but only one can provide you with the $500, we will show your application to the the lender that can give you the $500.</p>
<p>After a lender is matched with your application, you will be presented with the lender's loan terms. Should you agree with the terms after review, you  must accept the terms. After your agreement, the lender will direct-deposit the  loan funds to your bank account typically within the next business day.</p>
<p>If we do not find a lender that accepts your application, we will notify you that your application has been denied. This  happens within a matter of seconds.</p>
